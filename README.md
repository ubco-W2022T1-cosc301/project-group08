## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Because Apex Legend is now a popular game, and the competition of Apex Legend is also very interesting. As players of this game and spectators of competitive competitions, we are also interested in other games and their competitions. Therefore, we want to make some analysis on Apex Legend and other e-sports competitions, such as whether there are any factors that affect a team's victory. Is it the players of specific players who play better, or the team's income that makes the players more powerful? Is there a player in a team so important that if he leaves, the team will play worse? About the general development of an e-sports event these years, are there more tournaments in this game each year or less than before? What is the proportion of income sources of some well-known clubs and the prize pool of the competition to analyze the most popular e-sports events? How does the income propotion and prize pool size related?
