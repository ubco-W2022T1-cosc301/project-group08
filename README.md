## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Since Apex Legend is a hot game right now and as players of this game, we are feeling interest with the players and their teams. Therefore we want to do some analysis about those teams that apart from the players' talent, if there any other factors that influences wheather a team wins or not. Are players with specific team members playing better or the team income makes the players more powerful? Is there a player in a team so important that if he leaves then the team would play worse?
Some specific questions we want to find out through this analysis project are : 1)"If there is a relationship between player winning amount, team winning amount and team income ranking? " 2)"Does income ranking related with last year's team ranking?" A DashBoard with this datast can be imagined but there must be multiple boards to different players and different teams.
