<h1>Final Report of MileStone - Project Group 08</h1>

<h2>Introduction of database and our focus</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With the development of technology, hardware becomes more and more powerful which makes the video games much fancier. The oldest games are pixel style and players can only see the general shape of everything in the game. As technology becomes more and more developed, video games are nowadays much developed than before. Video games have nowadays part of our daily life. There are new games released every month and there are even races set for video game players. Some people even play video games as their jobs, which is something that seems unbelievable last century. Our team is interesting about how developed the e-sport event is so far.
</p>

<h2>What is our databse and our focus</h2>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The database we use is about the players, organizations, the organizations' earnings and their earning ranks in different e-sport races. Our primary focus is data for game Apex-Legend which is a game released in recent years. We want to find out that how the general e-sport environment is developed and how are the new games influencing the development process.

<h2>Analysis on game Apex-Legend</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Apex Legend is a First Person Shooting(FPS) battle royal game which was first released in 2019-2-4 on PC,PS4 and XBOX. The first global race event was held in the same year it released. There wasn't much team joining the race event in 2019 since Apex was a completely new area in e-sport racing events and only about 100 teams were in the competition. Then, in the year 2020, team numbers doubled and so did the in year 2021. The prize pool of Apex e-sport races, similarly, increased dramatically each year.The year 2022 is special because of the COVID pandemic and we are still in this year, therefore data from this year is less useful for general analysis since there are no data supporting development after this year.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Teams that join the e-sport race changes every year. There are new teams joining into the race event and old teams leaving before and after, or even during the race events. However, based on 2019 - 2020 data, the general amount of teams, players and public focus rises by time. Every year, the top 5 teams earning the same proportion of the year prize pool, while since the prize pool itself increased each year, therefore the top teams also earns more year by year.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The game players are one of the major factor of how popular the game is. From database we found that all of the players have two or three two social media links that is public (as player account) and some players even have 4. The great amount of social media links shows that how widely and fast the information of this game can spread out. The spread of information is also a proof of the popularity of the e-sport event.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All data shows that Apex e-sport event is becoming more and more popular each year, therefore we can conclude that e-sport event of game Apex may kept becoming more and more popular in the future.
</p>

<h2>Analysis on the whole e-sport environment</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the general e-sport environment, there are areas that appears much older than Apex, for example,CS:GO, Fortnite, League of Legends and DOTA2. Most large e-sport teams, especially those top ones, are in a form more like a company that different players joining different game events at the same time. There are some areas that are their major income reference and most teams' main income comes from CS:GO and DOTA2. These are two games that was published more than 10 years ago. They proves that the development of e-sport events is not only about creating new games, old games also plays an important role in the development of e-sport event. They may or may not become less popular in the future, but currently they are the main strength of e-sport event. The new games only occupies a little proportion of the total income to those large teams.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Generally, games that releases longer have a higher proportion of revenue to the team. Therefore we can conclude that the e-sport event of other games are also more and more developed by time.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
The general e-sport event is having a trend of becoming more popular and influential in the future. It is obviously that there will be more games and even more new types of games added into the general environment and attracts more people. The more and more influential event may also feedback the game industry by providing more money to develop new games. This will (hopefully) form a virtuous circle and continuously boost up the development of both gaming industry and gaming events. If the boost up speed is fast enough, we may even possible to see games that are completely virtual reality, which means playing games without moving our body physically and only using our brain to control the game.
